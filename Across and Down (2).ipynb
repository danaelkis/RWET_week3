    "For a while, i haven’t done any crosswords. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is was one of my favourite morning routines in Tel Aviv, meet with my best friend Gil for coffee, he would drink his coffee, i would desperately look for a crosswords that no one made in the news papers and for 1 hour i would be day-dreaming to find the right answer for each clue. after solving the crosswords, we would still have another 20 minutes before heading to our offices. and then the fun would begin, because the crossword is over it doesn’t mean you cant use it, so for another 20 minutes i would try to write a short poem with the clues and answers of the crossword. \n",
    "\n",
    "I even had a small project where i scanned a crossword book that i bought in an airport and \n",
    "When I deleted the code, the grid, and the punctuation marks, that left only clues.  The clues became parts of sentences or words that asked, like the puzzle, to be solved and perhaps to be read as something new.\n",

    "I thought a lot about the idea of these experiments trying to take down a state of power. or reveal a new layer of a given text. it seems like to do it in english will be more hard since the poetry and my beloved and cherished texts are all in Hebrew but i am full power to reveal new ways to read / write and intterputate where i am right now.\n",
    "I think that going to the crosswords was an \"easy\" solution for me, maybe like the microphone checks. since it has a universal code of understanding what it is. i expect myself in the next assignment maybe to find a new category of texts and let my self be more critical."
